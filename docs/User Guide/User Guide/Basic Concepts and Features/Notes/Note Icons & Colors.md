# Note Icons & Colors
## Icons

<figure class="image image-style-align-right image_resized" style="width:48.4%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:1089/995;" src="Note Icons &amp; Colors_image.png" width="1089" height="995"></figure>

Icons are useful for distinguishing notes and are displayed near the note title, as well as in various places such as the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Text/Links/Internal%20(reference)%20links.md">Internal (reference) links</a> or the <a class="reference-link" href="../Navigation/Jump%20to%20%26%20command%20palette.md">Jump to &amp; command palette</a>.

While editing a note, click on the icon next to the title to bring up a chooser gallery.

Under the Vellum and Lumen themes, the icons those themes remap are shown in their Tabler equivalents, in the gallery as well as in the tree.

Icons can be inherited through the use of <a class="reference-link" href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Templates.md">Templates</a>, or <a class="reference-link" href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes/Attribute%20Inheritance.md">Attribute Inheritance</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> At the technical level, they are set by the `iconClass` attribute which adds a CSS class to the note. For example `#iconClass="bx bx-calendar"` will show a calendar instead of the default page or folder icon. Looking up and remembering the CSS class names is not necessary.

## Colors

Notes can also carry a custom color. Similar to the note icon, this color will be shown in various places such as the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Text/Links/Internal%20(reference)%20links.md">Internal (reference) links</a>.

To set a custom color, right click on the note in the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a> and select a predefined color from there or use the color picker (last option).

Alternatively, a custom color can be set manually through the `#color` [label](../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes/Labels.md), whose value must be a valid hex color including the leading `#` (e.g. `#ff0000` for red). This color can be carried over across multiple notes via <a class="reference-link" href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes/Attribute%20Inheritance.md">Attribute Inheritance</a>.
